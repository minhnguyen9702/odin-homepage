        <p>
          "Hey, I'm Solid Snake. You might know me as a soldier, a covert
          operative, or the guy who’s had to save the world a few times. I
          specialize in infiltration, stealth, and taking down impossible
          threats—usually solo. I’ve spent my life on the frontlines, from
          dismantling rogue military factions to preventing nuclear disasters.
          Sure, it hasn’t been easy, but someone has to get the job done. Here,
          you’ll find more about my missions, my story, and what drives me. If
          you’re looking for a quiet life, you won’t find it here. But if you’re
          ready to face the truth, you’re in the right place."
